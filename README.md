## Monsters App

App written as a recruitment task to [codequest](https://codequest.com/). Monster app displays info about creatures fetched from [monsters-api](https://github.com/codequest-eu/monsters-api).

There are two sections: Monsters list and Monsters details.

The first one allows users to filter monsters depending on their name and statistics.
The second one is a simple swiper, displaying more information about the monster.

Navigation is handled by [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom).

There are also two plugins: [react-id-swiper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-id-swiper) and [react-input-range](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-input-range) to help handle complex functionality.

For a better understanding of the data flow in the project, app is created using TypeScript.
